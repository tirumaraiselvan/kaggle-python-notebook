# kaggle-python-notebook

This quickstart consists of one microservice:


jupyter: Runs [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook with scipy (and other data analysis libraries) installed for building, analysing and visualising models interactively.

Follow along below to get the setup working on your cluster.

## Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have the [hasura cli](https://docs.hasura.io/0.15/manual/install-hasura-cli.html) tool installed on your system.

```sh
$ hasura version
```

Once you have installed the hasura cli tool, login to your Hasura account

```sh
$ # Login if you haven't already
$ hasura login
```


* You should also have [git](https://git-scm.com) installed.

```sh
$ git --version
```

## Getting started

```sh
$ # Run the quickstart command to get the project
$ hasura quickstart hasura/kaggle-python-notebook

$ # Navigate into the Project
$ cd kaggle-python-notebook
```

## Add Kaggle dataset

Download any Kaggle dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com). Then, copy the dataset into the `input` folder in the `jupyter` microservice.

```sh
$ # Ensure that you are in the kaggle-python-notebook directory
$ cp ~/Downloads/train.csv microservices/jupyter/input/
$ cp ~/Downloads/test.csv microservices/jupyter/input/

```

In case the dataset is a zip, you may wish to extract it and then copy the files as above.

## Deploy app

```sh
$ # Ensure that you are in the kaggle-python-notebook directory
$ # Git add, commit & push to deploy to your cluster
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'First commit'
$ git push hasura master
```

Once the above commands complete successfully, your cluster will have `jupyter` service  running. To get their URLs

```sh
$ # Run this in the scipy-jupyter-notebook directory
$ hasura microservice list
```

```sh

You can access the services at the `EXTERNAL-URL` for the respective service.

## Exploring Jupyter

### Open the Jupyter service

Head over to the EXTERNAL-URL of your `jupyter` service.

### Authentication

```sh
$ # Run this in the scipy-jupyter-notebook directory
$ hasura ms logs jupyter
```

Copy the authentication token from the logs and enter it in the jupyter UI above. 

```sh
Executing the command: jupyter notebook

```


### Training models

Once you authenticate Jupyter, you should see a `work` directory. This is where your data including `input` is persisted. You should create your notebooks in this directory so that your data is available even if your service restarts.

And that's it! Start building your models.
